# Forecasting Demand Project

This project demonstrates demand forecasting using LightGBM in Amazon SageMaker. 
The dataset contains historical sales data for multiple stores and product families. 

Key features:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation with LightGBM
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- Focused on RMSE performance on validation data

This notebook serves as a portfolio project for Machine Learning Engineering, showing practical experience in model training, experiment tracking, and working in cloud environments.
